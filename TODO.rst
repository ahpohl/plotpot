Graphical user interface (GUI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a graphical user interface for Plotpot, called by plotpot gui. Use as 
many methods from the Plot, Data and Journal classes as possible. Keep the 
command line program intact and let the user choose to use the gui or not.
As the gui matures, the console interface will be depreciated at some point.
